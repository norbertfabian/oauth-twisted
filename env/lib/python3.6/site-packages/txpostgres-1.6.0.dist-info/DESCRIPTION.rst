txpostgres
==========

A Twisted wrapper for asynchronous PostgreSQL connections.

Based on the interface exposed from the native Postgres C library by the Python
psycopg2 driver.

Can be used as a drop-in replacement for Twisted's adbapi module when working
with PostgreSQL. The only part that does not provide 100% compatibility is
connection pooling, although pooling provided by txpostgres is very similar to
the one Twisted adbapi offers.
